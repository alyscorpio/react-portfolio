# REACT PORTFOLIO

Welcome to my react portfolio! This is just like my original portfolio, only created using react! My name is Alys Dickerson and I started software development just a few months ago when I decided to enroll in a coding bootcamp at UCLA. What you see here is a representation of my work, but there is much more on my GitHub profile.
